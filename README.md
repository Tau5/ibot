iBot
===================


Welcome to the official iBot repository! Here you can find the latest version available. If you are here to translate the bot into your language (all are accepted), please read just below the instructions.

----------


Translation

> **Instructions:**

> - Download the `en.json` file located in `src/translations/`.
> - With a classic text editor such as **Notepad++**, replace the right-side of lines with the translated version ({x} where x is a number are arguments such as the member tag, etc).
> - **NOTICE** Don't forget to change the `locale` parameter using the format `en-GB` (example: `fr-FR`, or `fr-CA`). Change the `currency` thing also.
